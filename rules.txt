InCogneto: 

A turn based game, controlled with the little finger: 

With your opponent choose whether your hostage is the Moose or the bald Hedgehog.

To win you must force the opponent's hostage off the rack. 
To do this you must build a working set of gears that can turn the rack in the best direction to push their hostage off their seat. 

To push the Moose off, move the rack to the left. 
To push the Bald Hedgehog off, move the rack to the right. 

The winner is the first to dunk the hostage. 

On each go a player can choose to: 
Add a cog
Remove a Cog
Change one of the oppositions Cogs
Make a Cog a Crumble Cog
Move the CogMask. 

At the end of each go the Drive Cog will turn.
